/*! \param func Function call to execute in the worker thread

call() executes a CUDA call to in a worker thread. Any function
with any arguments can be passed in to be queued using boost::bind.
Examples:
\code
gpu.call(bind(function, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...));
gpu.call(bind(cudaMemcpy, &h_float, d_float, sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));
gpu.call(bind(cudaThreadSynchronize));
\endcode
The only requirement is that the function returns a cudaError_t. Since every
single CUDA Runtime API function does so, you can call any Runtime API function.
You can call any custom functions too, as long as you return a cudaError_t representing
the error of any CUDA functions called within. This is typical in kernel
driver functions. For example, a .cu file might contain:
\code
__global__ void kernel() { ... }
cudaError_t kernel_driver()
{
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>();
#ifdef NDEBUG
return cudaSuccess;
#else
cudaThreadSynchronize();
return cudaGetLastError();
#endif
}
\endcode
It is recommended to just return cudaSuccess in release builds to keep the asynchronous
call stream going with no cudaThreadSynchronize() overheads.

call() ensures that \a func has been executed before it returns. This is
desired behavior, most of the time. For calling kernels or other asynchronous
CUDA functions, use callAsync(), but read the warnings in it's documentation
carefully and understand what you are doing. Why have callAsync() at all?
The original purpose for designing ThreadWorker is to allow execution on
multiple GPUs simultaneously which can only be done with asynchronous calls.

An exception will be thrown if the CUDA call returns anything other than
cudaSuccess.
*/
void ThreadWorker::call(const std::function<ThreadWorker::error_t(void)>& func, int device) {
    // this mutex lock is to prevent multiple threads from making
    // simultaneous calls. Thus, they can depend on the exception
    // thrown to exactly be the error from their call and not some
    // race condition from another thread
    // making ThreadWorker calls to a single ThreadWorker from multiple threads
    // still isn't supported
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(m_call_mutex);

    // call and then sync
    callAsync(func, device);
    sync(device);
}

/*! \param func Function to execute inside the worker thread

callAsync is like call(), but  returns immeadiately after entering \a func into the queue.
The worker thread will eventually get around to running it. Multiple contiguous
calls to callAsync() will result in potentially many function calls
being queued before any run.

\warning There are many potential race conditions when using callAsync().
For instance, consider the following calls:
\code
gpu.callAsync(bind(cudaMalloc(&d_array, n_bytes)));
gpu.callAsync(bind(cudaMemcpy(d_array, h_array, n_bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice)));
\endcode
In this code sequence, the memcpy async call may be created before d_array is assigned
by the malloc call leading to an invalid d_array in the memcpy. Similar race conditions
can show up with device to host memcpys. These types of race conditions can be very hard to
debug, so use callAsync() with caution. Primarily, callAsync() should only be used to call
cuda functions that are asynchronous normally. If you must use callAsync() on a synchronous
cuda function (one valid use is doing a memcpy to/from 2 GPUs simultaneously), be
\b absolutely sure to call sync() before attempting to use the results of the call.

\warning Arguments that are passed into the function call by bind are put into a queue.
They may have a lifetime longer than that of the caller. If any function performs a
callAsync and uses pointers to stack variables in the call, sync() \b must be called
at the end of the function to avoid problems. Similarly, sync() must be called in the
destructor of any class that passes pointers to member variables into callAsync().

The best practice to avoid problems is to always call sync() at the end of any function
that uses callAsync().
